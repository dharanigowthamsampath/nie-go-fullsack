### MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Basics  

The **aggregation pipeline** in MongoDB is a powerful framework for data processing and transformation. It allows you to perform operations such as filtering, grouping, sorting, and computing derived values efficiently.

---

### **1. Basic Structure**
An aggregation pipeline consists of multiple stages, where each stage processes documents and passes the output to the next stage.

```js
db.collection.aggregate([
  { stage1 },
  { stage2 },
  { stage3 }
])
```

---

### **2. Common Aggregation Stages**
Here are some fundamental stages used in aggregation:

#### **1. `$match` (Filtering Documents)**
Filters documents based on a condition (similar to `find`).

```js
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "shipped" } }
])
```

#### **2. `$group` (Grouping and Aggregating)**
Groups documents by a specific field and applies aggregate functions.

```js
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId", totalSpent: { $sum: "$amount" } } }
])
```

#### **3. `$project` (Selecting and Reshaping Fields)**
Includes or excludes specific fields in the output.

```js
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $project: { _id: 0, customer: 1, totalAmount: 1 } }
])
```

#### **4. `$sort` (Sorting Results)**
Sorts documents in ascending (`1`) or descending (`-1`) order.

```js
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $sort: { totalAmount: -1 } }
])
```

#### **5. `$limit` and `$skip` (Pagination)**
- `$limit`: Limits the number of results.
- `$skip`: Skips a certain number of documents.

```js
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $sort: { totalAmount: -1 } },
  { $skip: 10 },
  { $limit: 5 }
])
```

#### **6. `$lookup` (Joining Collections)**
Performs a left join between collections.

```js
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "customers",
      localField: "customerId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "customerDetails"
    }
  }
])
```

#### **7. `$unwind` (Deconstructing Arrays)**
Breaks an array field into multiple documents.

```js
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$items" }
])
```

---

### **3. Example Aggregation Pipeline**
Find the total sales per product for orders shipped in 2024:

```js
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "shipped", year: 2024 } },
  { $group: { _id: "$productId", totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
  { $sort: { totalSales: -1 } }
])
```

This filters orders shipped in 2024, groups them by product, sums the total sales, and sorts the results in descending order.

### **4. When to Use Aggregation?**
- When performing complex queries involving multiple stages.
- When needing to transform, analyze, and summarize data.
- When performing operations like joins (`$lookup`), grouping, or complex filtering.
