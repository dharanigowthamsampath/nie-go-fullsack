### **MongoDB Data Deletion Basics**  

In MongoDB, you can delete documents from a collection using the following methods:

---

## **1. Delete a Single Document**
The `deleteOne()` method removes the first document that matches the filter.

### **Example**
```js
db.users.deleteOne({ name: "John Doe" })
```
âœ… **Deletes one document** where `name` is "John Doe".

---

## **2. Delete Multiple Documents**
The `deleteMany()` method removes all documents that match the filter.

### **Example**
```js
db.users.deleteMany({ age: { $gt: 30 } })
```
âœ… **Deletes all users** older than 30.

---

## **3. Delete All Documents in a Collection**
To remove all documents from a collection without dropping the collection:

### **Example**
```js
db.users.deleteMany({})
```
âœ… **Deletes all documents** in the `users` collection.

---

## **4. Drop an Entire Collection**
To delete the collection itself (along with all documents):

### **Example**
```js
db.users.drop()
```
âœ… **Completely removes the `users` collection**.

---

## **5. Delete Using `_id`**
Since `_id` is unique, deleting by `_id` ensures only one document is deleted.

### **Example**
```js
db.orders.deleteOne({ _id: ObjectId("65a8bfbf4d2a3c8f1f3c1234") })
```
âœ… **Deletes the document with the specific `_id`**.
