# 🚀 Setting Up Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that helps in designing responsive and visually appealing web pages. It provides pre-styled components and a grid system to simplify web development.

## 📌 Including Bootstrap in Your Project

There are two main ways to include Bootstrap in your project:

### 1️⃣ Using a CDN (Recommended for Beginners)

The easiest way to use Bootstrap is via a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Add the following `<link>` in the `<head>` of your HTML file:

```html copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Bootstrap Setup</title>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="text-center">Hello, Bootstrap!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 2️⃣ Installing via npm (For Advanced Users)

If you're using a build tool like Webpack or Vite, install Bootstrap via npm:

```sh
npm install bootstrap
```

Then, import Bootstrap in your main CSS or JS file:

```js
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js";
```

## 📌 Verifying Bootstrap Installation

To check if Bootstrap is working, add a Bootstrap class to an element. For example:

```html copy
<button class="btn btn-primary">Click Me</button>
```

If the button appears styled, Bootstrap is successfully installed! 🎉
