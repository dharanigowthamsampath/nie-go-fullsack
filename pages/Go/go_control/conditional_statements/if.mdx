# **`if` Statement in Go**

## **Introduction**

The `if` statement in Go is used for decision-making. It checks a condition and executes a block of code only if the condition is **true**.

---

## **Syntax of `if` Statement**

```go filename="main.go" copy
if condition {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
```

- The **condition** must return a boolean (`true` or `false`).
- The block inside `{}` executes only if the condition is `true`.
- If the condition is `false`, nothing happens.

---

## **Example: Checking a Positive Number**

```go filename="main.go" copy
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    num := 10

    if num > 0 {
        fmt.Println("The number is positive")
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**

1. The variable `num` is assigned `10`.
2. The condition `num > 0` is checked.
3. Since `10` is greater than `0`, the condition is **true**.
4. The statement inside `if` executes, printing `"The number is positive"`.

If `num` were negative or `0`, nothing would print because the `if` condition would be **false**.

---

## **Example: Checking Even Number**

```go filename="main.go" copy
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    num := 8

    if num%2 == 0 {
        fmt.Println("The number is even")
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**

1. `num := 8` assigns `8` to `num`.
2. The condition `num%2 == 0` checks if `num` is divisible by `2`.
3. Since `8` is even, the condition is **true**.
4. `"The number is even"` is printed.

---

## **Example: Using `if` with Short Variable Declaration**

Go allows you to declare a variable inside `if`.

```go filename="main.go" copy
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    if age := 20; age >= 18 {
        fmt.Println("You are an adult")
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**

1. `age := 20` is **declared inside** `if`.
2. The condition `age >= 18` checks if the age is **18 or older**.
3. Since `20` is greater than `18`, the condition is **true**.
4. `"You are an adult"` is printed.
5. The variable `age` exists **only inside the `if` block**.

---

## **Conclusion**

- The `if` statement is used for conditional execution.
- The condition must return `true` or `false`.
- If the condition is `false`, the code inside `{}` is skipped.
- You can declare a variable inside `if`.
